# Whip boxes

This demo is for demonstrating Hilo.DomElement animating via Hilo.Tween.

As you can see in the source code, each box is a div.

# To be continued

If each `Tween.to()` is set to `loop: true, reverse: true`, the whip would be 'broken'.

Here we use a setInterval so that whip animation is performed discretely, every 2s in our case.
